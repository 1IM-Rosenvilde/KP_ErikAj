(live: 0.4s)["What's really going on here, Moriko?" you ask, your voice low. "What is this presence we keep feeling?"]

(live: 0.8s)[Moriko takes a slow breath, his eyes scanning the distance before looking back at you.]

(live: 1.2s)["The **Saint’s Promenade**... It's more than just an old pathway," he says softly. "This is a place where ancient powers converge. It’s a place where time and fate twist in strange ways. The presence you feel? It’s the weight of centuries of forgotten magic, the echoes of power from before the world knew order."]

(live: 1.6s)[His expression is solemn, eyes filled with a depth of understanding that hints at darker things.]

(live: 2.0s)["But... we must continue. If we're to reach the **Everflame**, we must push forward. Whatever it is we face, we cannot turn back." He looks at you seriously. "Trust in your strength and your companions." You nod, feeling his words linger in the air.]

(live: 0.8s)[His armor is broken, worn, but the aura he radiates is undeniable.]

(live: 1.2s)[Beside him, a figure cloaked in shadow moves silently, standing close, a subtle hint of familiarity in the way they hold themselves.]

(live: 1.6s)[The Emperor speaks, not with words but with a voice felt deep in your mind. "Seekers of fate... You dare to trespass into the realm of the forgotten. Do you not know the price?"]

(live: 2.0s)[Levan steps back, eyes wide with uncertainty, his hand hovering near his wound, but he says nothing.]

(live: 2.4s)[The cloaked figure near the Emperor shifts slightly, their posture tense, as though prepared to act at any moment.]

(live: 2.8s)[You glance between the two of them, feeling the weight of the moment pressing in. The air itself seems charged, and the sense of power radiating from the Emperor is almost suffocating.]

(live: 3.2s)["What do you want from us?" Levan asks, voice a little strained.]

(live: 3.6s)[The Emperor remains silent for a moment, his presence still overwhelming.]

(live: 4.0s)[The cloaked figure steps forward slightly, their gaze piercing, as if studying you carefully. But still, no words come from them.]

(live: 1.2s)[Moriko keeps a steady pace, his eyes flicking to the shadowed corners of the street. Levan, on the other hand, seems lost in thought, occasionally glancing back as if searching for something.]

(live: 1.6s)[You feel it again—a strange sensation, an unsettling presence, pulling at the edges of your mind.]

(live: 2.0s)[The air feels heavier, the world itself seemingly holding its breath.]

(live: 2.4s)[Moriko looks over his shoulder, his face unreadable. "You feel it too, don't you?" he says, his voice low.]

(live: 2.8s)[Moriko glances at him. "This is no ordinary place. Something stirs here, something old."]

(live: 3.2s)[Levan lets out a quiet breath. "I don't like it... but we need to keep moving. Whatever it is, it's not a good sign."]

(live: 3.6s)[As you continue walking, the path gradually ascends, winding its way toward the distant silhouette of **The Everflame Beacon**, now visible against the horizon.]

(live: 4.0s)[As you near the base of the Beacon's stairs, the feeling intensifies. Your heart beats faster. There's something at the top, something waiting.]

(live: 4.4s)[You stop for a moment, trying to shake off the unease.]

(live: 0.8s)[For a moment, it looks like he’ll be swept away.]
(live: 1.6s)[But then, with a surge of effort, he grabs onto a broken tree root near the bank.]
(live: 2.4s)[He hauls himself out of the water, coughing and shivering.]

(live: 3.2s)[You turn to leave, but hear him calling after you weakly.]
(live: 4.0s)[“Wait... You were going to let me drown.”]

(live: 4.8s)[You say nothing. There's no trust built here — only silence and tension.]

(live: 5.6s)[The man slowly stands, soaked and shaking, but alive.]
(live: 6.4s)[“...Name’s Levan,” he mutters. “I guess we’re both lost here.”]

(live: 3.6s)["You may have heard the stories of Maximoria and the wars that followed. What you may not know," Moriko continues, "is that the Emperor, Evantor, once ruled over much of this land. But his greed for power led him to make terrible choices. The people rebelled, and eventually, the Emperor was sealed away... in a prison, far, far beneath Maximoria."]

(live: 4.0s)[Moriko pauses, his gaze distant, as though reflecting on the tale. "The exact location of that prison is a mystery. Rumors say it lies far under the city, deep in the earth, hidden from the world. Only a few know the truth... and those who do dare not speak of it."]

(live: 2.4s)[Before you can speak, a strange sensation fills the air. The world around you flickers, reality warping like a mirage. Suddenly, the ground beneath your feet disappears, and you are thrust into an alternate dimension.]

(live: 2.8s)[The air is thick with energy, the colors swirling around you in a kaleidoscope of light. Time feels distorted, and everything seems to stretch beyond the horizon. You see flashes of Rila’s past, vivid memories that flood your senses.]

(live: 3.2s)[You stand in a young village, surrounded by people—Rila’s people. You see images of Rila and the hooded man, side by side, growing up together. You see their laughter, their struggles, their bond. You see them as children, unaware of the powers that lay within them.]

(live: 3.6s)[The memories shift, and you feel Rila’s pain. You witness moments of loss, of betrayal, of solitude. You feel the loneliness Rila experienced as they wandered, searching for answers. But then, through the haze, you see the moment Rila left.]

(live: 4.8s)[The vision fades as quickly as it came, and you are thrust back into reality. You blink, disoriented, and look at The mysterious guy behind Evantor.]

(live: 5.2s)[The truth is undeniable now. You are connected to him by more than just an enemy. You are brothers—siblings separated by fate but destined to reunite.]

(live: 5.6s)[He takes of his hood and looks at you, his expression soft and full of regret.]

Emperor: "Enough! You will bow before me, or I will make you regret ever defying me."

(live: 4.8s)[The vision fades as quickly as it came, and you are thrust back into reality. You blink, disoriented, and look at Moriko.]

(live: 2.8s)["A deal’s a deal. Supplies for your travels. Don’t say Stigi never gives back!"]

(live: 3.2s)[You receive dried rations, a potion of minor healing, and a scrap-forged talisman said to ward off minor curses.]

(live: 3.6s)[Moriko raises an eyebrow, but says nothing.]

(live: 4.0s)["Watch your back out there," Stigi warns. "This world’s no friend to strangers."]

(live: 0.4s)[The three of you—**you**, **Levan**, and **Moriko**—step out of the tavern into the misty night.]
(live: 0.8s)[The streets glisten with recent rain, and the distant hum of nocturnal creatures stirs beyond the city's wooden walls.]
(live: 1.2s)[As you walk, Moriko speaks in a low voice.]

(live: 1.6s)["Zeyvar is a fractured realm," he begins. "Not born, but **torn** into existence. It wasn't always like this."]
(live: 2.0s)["Long ago, the veil between planets was ripped open. Power poured in... and with it, **chaos**."]
(live: 2.4s)[He pauses, looking up at the stormy sky.]
(live: 2.8s)["Some rose to protect the land. Others? They sought dominion. That’s where **he** came in... the Emperor."]
(live: 3.2s)["Evantor was once a man, they say. But what he became... was something else. Something unnatural."]
(live: 3.6s)["He bent shadows and flame, raised monuments of fear, and demanded worship. Whole cities fell under his will."]

(live: 4.0s)[Levan walks in silence, listening intently.]
(live: 4.4s)[You feel a chill crawl along your spine as Moriko continues.]

(live: 4.8s)["Some believe he still whispers in the dark places of the world. That his touch never fully faded."]
(live: 5.2s)["I need to know the truth. And the **Everflame**... it’s where legends say echoes of the first light still burn."]
(live: 5.6s)["If anything can reveal the truth, or the path forward... it's there."]

(live: 6.0s)[You exchange a glance with Levan. Your journey has just begun, but already the weight of something ancient presses on your chest.]

(live: 0.0s)[As the two of you walk down a muddy path lined with crooked lanterns, the silence is broken.]

(live: 1.0s)["Name’s Rilo," you say, your voice low. "I came here with my brother. Something… took him. And I lost my powers when it happened. I don’t even know what I am here."]

(live: 2.5s)[Levan nods slowly, his expression unreadable. "Rilo, huh? That’s not a name from around here. But then again, neither are you."]

(live: 3.5s)["This place—Zeyvar—isn’t just one world. It’s many, mashed together like pieces of broken glass. Things end up here… people, ruins, magic."]

(live: 4.5s)["Most folk just survive. But a rare few are chosen—marked by the Divine Blessing. They say it grants power, purpose… a connection to something higher."]

(live: 5.5s)["But blessings are rare. And lately? They're going silent. Like the gods turned their backs."]

(live: 6.5s)[He glances at you. "Maybe you’ll get yours back. Or maybe Zeyvar has something else in store for you. Either way... best to keep your guard up."]

(live: 7.5s)[You arrive at the edge of a lantern-lit square, where a crooked wooden sign swings in the breeze: **The Withered Flame Tavern**.]

  (live: 0.8s)[Levan winces slightly as he takes a step, his movements slower than usual. It’s clear that the fight earlier has taken a toll on him, but he’s trying to hide it.]
  (live: 1.2s)[You glance at him, concerned, but he brushes it off with a forced smile. "I’m fine," he mutters, though his voice lacks its usual confidence.]

(live: 1.6s)[Moriko walks ahead of you, his steps measured and purposeful. "We may not have much time," he says quietly. "The Emperor’s influence is spreading, and with it, darker forces. We must act quickly."]

(live: 2.0s)[As you continue down the road, the landscape shifts. The rocky terrain gives way to dense forest, and the air grows cooler.]

(live: 2.4s)[You can feel the tension in the air, as if the world itself is holding its breath. Every step you take feels like you're moving deeper into something unknown.]

(live: 2.8s)[Levan suddenly stops and turns to you. "Tell me more about your journey," he says, his eyes searching yours. "How did you end up in Zeyvar? What is it that you’re really seeking here?" he asks, his curiosity evident.]

(live: 3.2s)[Moriko doesn’t speak, but his hand rests lightly on the hilt of his sword. He seems to be keeping watch for any threats that might appear along the path.]
